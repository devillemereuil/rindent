# rindent
Katepart indentation for R scripts

## Install for a KDE4-based version

Copy R-KDE4.js into `/usr/share/kde4/share/apps/katepart/script/indentation/` then select R indentation in the Indentation tab of the Editor configuration panel in RKward.

Note that some new features included in R-KF5.js haven't been "backported" in R-KDE4.js because there were untested (now that I have a KF5-based RKWard).

## Install for KF5-based version
Copy R-KF5.js into `/usr/share/katepart5/script/indentation/` then select R indentation in the Indentation tab of the Editor configuration panel in RKward.
